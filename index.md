## Background

* The Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool (CKAT) runs on portable tablet computers and presents brief tests capable of recording high resolution, accurate measures of children’s manual dexterity 

* Across a series of tasks, children use a stylus to track moving targets, aim at static objects and steer through paths

* The screen recording on the next slide has been extracted at low-resolution for illustration purposes only- the stimuli display at native resolution

* Data have been collected on >10,000 children to date

* We look forward to meeting you on Friday and addressing your questions...
